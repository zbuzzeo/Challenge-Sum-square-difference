Sum square difference

    From Project Euler Problem 6


The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

There are **2** tests, make the first test pass.
Once the first test passes, change the second test so that it's true,
  fill in the actual correct values in the assertions.

(you'll need jasmine-node)
    npm install jasmine-node -g

run automated tests by running
    jasmine-node --autotest .
